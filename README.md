# MODpy
This repository has code to analyze MOD (MIT Open Data) files produced using [MODProducer]    
(https://github.com/rmastand/MODProducer "MODProducer" for latest version).    
It is an adaption of MODAnalyzer for implementation with python.    
(https://github.com/prekshan/MODAnalyzer/tree/master).  

Ensure that fastjet is installed and compiled.   
(http://www.fastjet.fr)   

###############################################################################  

<b>Process rough workflow:</b>   
Parse reads MOD_file(s) in the input folder.   
It calls the analyzeMOD function which removes 'bad' events due to: lumi blocks, trigger effects, Jet Quality Criteria, Fastjet comparison.   
It then creates a .dat file of the two hardest jet objects.  
Plot_dat then generates plots from this.   

This code runs using python3.   
...command to run the code from the MODpy folder is:  
python3 parse.py ~/path/to/folder/containing/MOD_files ~/output/folder/for/dat_files [optional] Number_of_events_limiter [optional]  
e.g. "python3 ~/Documents/MOD_files ~/Documents/MODpy_output 10000"   

######Comments about the plotting mechanism - for Joe to fill in#######   

<b>Cross-checking scripts are provided:</b>   
Print_MOD_file will print selected events from an argument input MOD file to allow manual comparison.  
Dat_file_length_check will compare the number of events in two argument input dat files, and print the first event difference where one exists.

<b>The EnergyFlow branch</b>

The EnergyFlow framework was used for central / forwards jet tagging on jet data generated by MODpy. In this branch, .consts files are now produced by the analyze_MOD function call. These are included for convenient input into the EnergyFlow interface. Four additional files are included in the energyflow directory. These are:
- efp_example.py: a copy of the EFP EnergyFlow example, included for quick reference
- efp_fc_training.py: a version of the above example adapted to use MODpy data to run the machine learning analysis on forwards/central jet labels
- fc_inputs.py: loads data from .consts files in a useful format for analysis of forwards and central jets
- auc_curve.py: a short file for plotting curves of AUC values

###############################################################################  
<b>TO DO:</b>   
Modify dat file structure to contain all events (including bad, with reason why rejected)   
Implement: CHS, pileup   
Introduce: Sim/GEN data, Machine-learning methods
